Read the instructions given below and try it:



1 You will have to create a server using core node_modules where there will be a root route (‘/’). 



2 When a user hits the root route(‘/) with GET request you will have to send an HTML file containing ‘‘Welcome to Full Stack Development “.



3 You will have to create a file in the root folder of your project called first.txt containing some text.

For example: “ I am a pull stack developer !!! 🤣 ”



 4 There will be four more routes to handle requests. When a user hits the routes you will have to do the following:



 1 '/read' - to read the first.txt file from the file system using the core fs module



2 '/write' - You have to read the text of the first.txt file and write it to the second.txt file.



3 '/append' - You have to append the text “ No! It will be full not pull ! 😑 ” in the first.txt file.



 4 '/delete' - You have to delete the second.txt file
